# Landing Page

I am learning web development from [the odin project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) foundations course.

This project is an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from the course. I am aiming to create a simple website (basic HTML, CSS and some flexbox). Wish me luck!
