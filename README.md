# Landing Page

I am learning web development from [the odin project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) foundations course.

This project is an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page) from the course. The idea is to create a simple website using html, css (in particular flexbox).

[Here](https://saayan007s.github.io/landing-page/) is the live preview.
